# Preface
	The app is a result of discussions among Mobien Tech. android developers. This hopefully will improve our productivity
	& streamline our approach towards starting with a new android project. There shall be more improvements as and
	when we find time and as an when we come up with something new. For now the project contains


# What all is there in the app.

	1. LoginActivity
		This is a basic login page we use here at mobien. It consists of all the validations we use in mobien.
		The EditText is set to take only NUMBERS as input. It has been set for numbers by using the property
		android:digits ="0123456789" in the corresponding xml under the corresponding component.

		All the developer needs to do in this activity is just check the TODO tags and its corresponding message and
		give parameters according to his/her need.

		P.S. : No Version Control implemented as of now.

	2. AfterLoginActivity
		This is an activity which comes after the login activity. This is nothing but the landing page of the application.
		Have kept the code such that if the user wants to go back from this activity he will be asked to log out.

	3. BasicWithoutWebcallActivity
		Just as the name suggests its an activity for normal use. I usually get irritated to write Context, Back Press code again and again.
		So this can be used by all those who don't want to write that part of repeated code again and again.

	4. App_Dialog
		The code also contains a dialog. Its made to show a dialog with two TextViews. A header and a body. When you see the code you will easily
		understand how to use it.

	5. Miscellaneous
		Have also put in webservices & utils package which we generally use while developing any kind of app.


		** Suggestions for improvements are more than welcome. **
